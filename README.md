> A LaTeX resume/cv template for DevOps Engineer to make quick update and
> pdf creation

This template I use for my own resume/CV.

```shell
docker  build -t latex-cv .
docker run -v $(pwd):/latex_content latex-cv /bin/sh -c "make pdf"
#docker run -v $(pwd):/latex_content --name latex-container latex-cv /bin/sh -c "make pdf"
#docker cp latex-container:/latex_content/cv-piotr-kowalski.pdf output.pdf
#docker remove /latex-container
```



## Install pre-requisites (Windows)

1. Install [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/howto/install-miktex), a TeX
   distribution for Windows that includes a large number of major packages.

2. Install an editor to edit and compile LaTeX documents:
  - [TexWorks](http://www.tug.org/texworks/) (comes with MiKTeX)
  - [TeXstudio](http://www.texstudio.org/)
  - [Texmaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/)

Once both the distribution and editor are installed, clone this repository
using `git clone` and open the template.tex file in your editor.

**Important**: Make sure to compile with XeLaTeX, not PDFLaTeX.
You're good to go!
